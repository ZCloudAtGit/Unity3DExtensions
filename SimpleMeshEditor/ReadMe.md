# Usage
1. Put all files into your Project
2. Add component 'Trangle.cs' to the mesh to edit.
3. Move mouse cursor on the mesh trangle, select one trangle to edit.
4. Drag the handle to move points around.

# Attention
If you want to keep the modified mesh when Unity3D is closed, you should serialize the mesh data back to the 3D model file yourself.
